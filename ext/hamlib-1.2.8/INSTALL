Basic Installation
==================

    For more information specific to this package, please read the README
file. This source code distribution  is autoconfiguring and you should be 
able to compile it and install it without manual interventions such as 
editing Makefiles, configuration files, and so on. These are generic 
instructions for people who are not familiar with installing autoconfiguring
software (along with some Hamlib-specific information).

The simplest way to compile this package is to enter the source code
main directory and do the following:
   
  1. Configure the source code by typing:
        
        $ ./configure

     If you're planning to install the package into your home directory
     or to a location other than `/usr/local' then add the flag
     `--prefix=PATH' to `configure'. For example, if your home directory  
     is `/home/username' you can configure the package to install itself 
     there by invoking:
        
        $ ./configure --prefix=/home/username

     N.B. If you know that you won't be using scripting languages (Perl,
     Python, or TCL) and that you won't need static libaries (most
     applications dynamically link Hamlib by default) invoke `configure'
     as follows:
     
        $ ./configure --without-perl-binding --without-python-binding \
        --without-tcl-binding --disable-static

     This will result in a much smaller Hamlib installation (and faster
     compilation :-) ).  See also the "Hamlib specific Features" section 
     below for other `configure' options.  
     
     While running, `configure' prints some messages telling you which
     features it is checking for. 

  2. Compile the package by typing:
        
        $ make
     
     Running `make' takes a while.  Since Hamlib is a package, now is the 
     time to go get a cup of coffee.
     
  3. Some packages are bundled with self-tests for source-code 
     verification. If this package includes such tests, you can 
     optionally run them after compilation by typing 

        $ make check

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation. Type `make uninstall' to undo the installation.

     During installation, the following files go to the following directories:
        Executables          -> /prefix/bin
        Libraries            -> /prefix/lib
        Public header files  -> /prefix/include
        Man pages            -> /prefix/man/man?
        Info files           -> /prefix/info
        Doc files            -> /prefix/share/doc/<prog name>
        Share files          -> /prefix/share/<prog name>
     where `prefix' is either `/usr/local' or the PATH that you specified
     in the `--prefix' flag.

     If any of these directories do not presently exist, they will be
     created on demand. 

     If you are installing in your home directory make sure that 
     `/home/username/bin' is in your path. If you're using the bash shell
     add these lines at the end of your .bashrc file:

        PATH="/home/username/bin:${PATH}"
        export PATH

     If you are using csh or tcsh, then use this line instead:

        setenv PATH /home/username/bin:${PATH}

     By prepending your home directory to the rest of the PATH you can
     override systemwide installed software with your own custom installation.

  5. After installation you may need to update the ld.so.cache as the 
     installation files are placed in /usr/local/lib by default.  On most
     systems this is easily accomplished by running the `ldconfig' command
     as the superuser (root).  The following line may need to be added to
     /etc/ld.so.conf:
     
        /usr/local/lib
     
     On Debian systems since at least 4.0 (Etch) and its derivatives (Ubuntu,
     etc.), a file will need to be created in the /etc/ld.so.conf.d directory.
     It doesn't seem to matter what you name it so long as it ends in .conf 
     and local.conf is a good choice.  Place the following line in it:
     
        /usr/local/lib
        
     Now `ldconfig' can be run.  
     
     While the programs built along with Hamlib will probably work fine
     without running `ldconfig', experience has shown that precompiled
     binaries like Fldigi will not be able to find libhamlib.so.2 without
     updating the ld.so.cache.
     
  6. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  The
     `configure' program will need to be run again to recompile Hamlib.

  7. You can optionally generate the Doxygen documentation files:

        cd doc
        make doc

     The HTML output files are provided for binary releases on the hamlib.org
     web site.
     
  8. Finally, if you wish to remove Hamlib, run `make uninstall' as 
     superuser (root), unless Hamlib was installed into your home directory,
     from the Hamlib source directory.  This will work unless `make distclean'
     has been run.

Compiler configuration
======================

   The `configure' shell script is responsible for choosing and configuring
the compiler(s). 

The following options allow you to specify whether you
want to enable or disable various debugging mechanisms:

`--enable-warnings'
      Make the compilers very picky about warnings. Try this whenever you
      write new code since it may catch a few bugs. This is not active by
      default because all too often warnings can be too picky and scare
      the end-user.

All programs are compiled with optimization level 2 by default (-O2).
Occasionally that confuses the debugger when code is inlined. To disable
optimization and enable debugging, set the shell environment variables
CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, FFLAGS to `-g'. On the bash shell, you can do this
like this:

  $ export CFLAGS="-g"
  $ export CXXFLAGS="-g"
  $ export FFLAGS="-g"

On the tcsh shell, use the `setenv' command instead:

  % setenv CFLAGS "-g"
  ...etc...

For other shell, please consult your shell's documentation.

Similarly, you can increase the optimization level by assigning these
variables to "-g -O3". 

Depending on what languages the package uses, some of these options may
or may not be available. To see what is available, type:
    % sh ./configure --help

About the configure script
==========================
 
   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

Advanced installation options.
==============================

   The `configure' script also understands the following more advanced
options, to handle situations for which `--prefix' alone is not sufficient.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.


Win32
=====
- Debian system with mingw32msvc cross-compiler

	./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc

- Mingw compiler under Cygwin 
	CC="gcc -mno-cygwin" CXX="g++ -mno-cygwin" ./configure --host=i686-pc-mingw32 

- Cygwin
	Native Cygwin requires no special options besides regular ones.


Hamlib specific Features
========================

   Should you encounter any problem with the build of the C++ binding,
you can disable this optional part by passing `--without-cxx-binding'
to the configure script (may happen under MacOSX).

   Any problem encountered with the perl, tcl, python or swig tool can be
disabled by passing `--without-tcl-binding', `--without-perl-binding',
and/or '--without-python-binding'.

   Some platfroms may have trouble compiling the RPC support (e.g. Mac OS X).
in such a case, the rpcrig and rpcrot backends may be disabled 
with the `--without-rpc-backends' option.

   Building static libraries can be disabled by use of the `--disable-static'
option.  This will reduce the installed size of Hamlib considerably.
