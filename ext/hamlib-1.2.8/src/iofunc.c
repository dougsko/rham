 *
 * Write a block of count characters to port file descriptor,

 *
 * The write_delay is for Yaesu type rigs..require 5 character
 * sequence to be sent with 50-200msec between each char.
 *
 * Also, post_write_delay is for some Yaesu rigs (eg: FT747) that
 * get confused with sequential fast writes between cmd sequences.
 *
 * input:
 *
 * fd - file descriptor to write to
 * txbuffer - pointer to a command sequence array
 * count - count of byte to send from the txbuffer
 * write_delay - write delay in ms between 2 chars
 * post_write_delay - minimum delay between two writes
 * post_write_date - timeval of last write
 *
 * Actually, this function has nothing specific to serial comm,
 * it could work very well also with any file handle, like a socket.
