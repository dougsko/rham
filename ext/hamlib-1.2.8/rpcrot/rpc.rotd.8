.SH NAME
rotd \- Hamlib rotator service daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rpc.rotd
[\fIOPTION\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBrotd\fP program is a \fBHamlib\fP rotator daemon that handles RPC 
client requests. This allows multiple user programs to share one rotator.  At 
this time multiple rotator support is not available (help needed!).
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
Keep in mind that \fBHamlib\fP is BETA level software. 
While a lot of backend libraries lack complete rig support, the basic functions
are usually well supported.  The API may change without publicized notice, 
while an advancement of the minor version (e.g. 1.1.x to 1.2.x) indicates such
a change.
.PP
Please report bugs and provide feedback at the e-mail address given in the 
REPORTING BUGS section.  Patches and code enhancements are also welcome.
.SH OPTIONS
This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').

Here is a summary of the supported options:
.TP
.B \-m, --model=id
Select rotator model number. See model list (use 'rotctl -l').
.br
NB: \fBrotctl\fP (or third party software) will use rotor model 101 
when using \fBrotd\fP.
.TP
.B \-r, --rot-file=device
Use \fIdevice\fP as the file name of the port the rotator is connected.
Often a serial port, but could be a USB to serial adapter.  Typically 
/dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1, /dev/ttyUSB0, etc.
.TP
.B \-s, --serial-speed=baud
Set serial speed to \fIbaud\fP rate. Uses maximum serial speed from rotor
backend as the default.
.TP
.B \-C, --set-conf=parm=val[,parm=val]*
Set config parameter.  e.g. stop_bits=2
.br
Use -L option of \fBrotctl\fP for a list.
.TP
.B \-t, --prog=number
Use \fInumber\fP as the RPC program number. The default is 536873369.
.TP
.B \-v, --verbose
Set verbose mode, cumulative (see DIAGNOSTICS below).
.TP
.B \-h, --help
Show summary of these options and exit.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Show version of \fBrpc.rotd\fP and exit.
.PP
Please note that the backend for the rotator to be controlled, 
or the rotator itself may not support some commands. In that case, 
the operation will fail with a \fBHamlib\fP error code.
.SH EXAMPLES
Start \fBrotd\fP as root for a RotorEZ using a USB to serial adapter and
backgrounding:
.PP
# rpc.rotd -m 401 -r /dev/ttyUSB1 &
.PP
Start \fBrotd\fP as root for a RotorEZ using COM1 while generating TRACE 
output:
.PP
# rpc.rotd -m 401 -r /dev/ttyS0 -vvvvv
.PP
Start \fBrotd\fP as root for a RotorEZ using a USB to serial adapter while
setting baud rate and stop bits and backgrounding:
.PP
# rpc.rotd -m 401 -r /dev/ttyUSB1 -s 4800 -C stop_bits=2 &
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The \fB-v\fP, \fB--version\fP option allows different levels of diagnostics
to be output to \fBstderr\fP and correspond to -v for BUG, -vv for ERR, 
-vvv for WARN, -vvvv for VERBOSE, or -vvvvv for TRACE.  
.PP
A given verbose level is useful for providing needed debugging information to
the email address below.  For example, TRACE output shows all of the values
sent to and received from the rotator which is very useful for rotator backend
library development and may be requested by the developers.
.SH SECURITY
No authentication whatsoever; could be done through domain restriction, 
though.  Please ask if stronger security is needed.
.SH BUGS
Does not support more than one communication device for multiple rotor control.
(e.g. for Single Operator 2 Radio)  Help needed!
.SH REPORTING BUGS
Report bugs to <hamlib-developer@lists.sourceforge.net>.

We are already aware of the bug in the previous section :-)
